1. Introduction
A surprisingly fun and efficient build, the Holy Freeze Zealot is known for his ability to attack large groups of monsters without fear of instant death. Due to the unavoidable slowing effect of Holy Freeze, this Zealot is a lot safer than most melee characters and can be built either on a budget or with very high end gear. Definitely recommended to newer players who want to get into playing melee.
