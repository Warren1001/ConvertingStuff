1. Introduction
The Fire Sorceress is a very strong but fragile character who will have good success early in the game but run into some Fire Immune monsters in Hell that will prove difficult. She can be very solid for farming a few specific areas such as Mephisto, Andariel, Cows, and more. However, to really cover a lot of ground she will need to add another element into her damage type.
