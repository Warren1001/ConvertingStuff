1. Introduction
The “Javazon” Amazon is a glass cannon character. She has extremely high damage output both in single target form (Charged Strike) as well as large Area of Effect clear (Lightning Fury). She is the fastest boss-killing character in the game and can be extremely useful in high density areas like The Secret Cow Level and the Chaos Sanctuary.
