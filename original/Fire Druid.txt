1. Introduction
The Fire Druid is known for being very strong in the early and mid game but running into a lot of Fire Immune monsters in Hell. That being said, he can be extremely strong in targeted farming of areas with few Fire Immune Monsters and overall still has great damage output to beat the game.

	2.5. Mercenary
You can either choose a Defensive (Holy Freeze) or Offensive (Might) Act 2 Nightmare Mercenary here depending on if you want even more slow and safety, or want your Mercenary to have added damage to help take care of Fire Immunes. I prefer Might Mercenary for this character. If running Phoenix I would not recommend Holy Freeze since it diminishes the viability of Redemption.
2.5.1. Mercenary Gear
Optimal Mercenary Gear
* Weapon: Eth Infinity
* Body Armor: Eth Fortitude
* Helm: Ral’d Eth Andariel’s Helm
Budget Mercenary Gear
* Weapon: Reaper’s Toll, Obedience, Honor
* Body Armor: Treachery
* Helm: Vampire Gaze, Crown of Thieves, Tal Rasha’s Horadric Crest
