1. Introduction
The Frost/Fire Amazon is a slight variation of the Frostmaiden build. Instead of running pure Ice with some Physical shots to deal with Cold Immune monsters, you are instead using Exploding Arrow. This build is generally seen as slightly worse than the Frostmaiden but can still complete Hell and isn’t insanely gear dependent.
2. Quick Reference
2.1. Skill Build
* Freezing Arrow - 20 Points - Main Damage and Crowd Control, required
* Cold Arrow- 20 Points - Synergy for Freezing Arrow, required
* Ice Arrow - 1 Point - Synergy for Freezing Arrow but only increases freeze length which isn’t super necessary, required
* Exploding Arrow - 20 Points - Main Fire Damage Skill, required
* Fire Arrow - 20 Points - Synergy for Exploding Arrow, required
* Critical Strike- 1 Point - Prerequisite for Pierce, required
* Penetrate- 1 Point - Prerequisite for Pierce, required
* Pierce - 9 Points after +Skills - When mixed with Razortail will give her 100% chance to Pierce enemies, increasing her damage a lot, required.
* Inner Sight -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Slow Missile -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Decoy -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Dodge -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Avoid -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Evade -1 Point - Prerequisite for Valkyrie, optional
* Valkyrie - 17+ Points after Soft Skills - Valkyrie is extremely helpful in tanking and is almost necessary in a Hardcore playthrough. If you do go for the Valkyrie, having at least 17 points total will give her the best gear so she can be more dominant.
* Magic Arrow - 1 Point - Prerequisite for Exploding Arrow, optional
* Multiple Shot - 1 Point - Prerequisite for Exploding Arrow, optional
