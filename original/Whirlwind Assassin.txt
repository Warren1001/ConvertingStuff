1. Introduction
The Whirlwind Assassin is a build utilizing the Runeword Chaos. It is very gear dependent and limited in its overall playstyles, but can be a lot of fun. It is a novelty build that has some use in PvP but generally isn’t used very often in PvE. By mixing in Traps she can become more viable and clear more areas at a faster pace.
