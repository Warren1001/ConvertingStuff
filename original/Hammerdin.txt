1. Introduction
One of the most popular characters in Diablo 2, the Hammerdin is an iconic Paladin build that revolves around the Blessed Hammer skill. Owing to impressive area of effect Magic damage that is very rarely resisted by monsters, the Hammerdin is the ultimate jack of all trades with unparalleled versatility throughout the entire game.
