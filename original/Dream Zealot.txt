1. Introduction
The Dream Zealot Paladin is a slight twist on the classic fast hitting melee character. He utilizes the runewords Dream to adjust his attacks from being purely physical to adding in lightning damage. This gives him a little bit more coverage in the monsters he fights and overall is just simply a different style of the Zealot. A strong melee character that can play through a lot of PvE content but does require some gear setup first.
