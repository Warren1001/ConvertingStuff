1. Introduction
The Throw Barbarian is a heavily gear dependent character that takes advantage of the Double Throw and Throwing Mastery Skills. While he can put out a lot of single target damage, his AOE is very lacking so make sure to be careful in large groups or use Howl to isolate Unique minions. Although playthrough damage without gear may take some time, eventually this Character is capable of taking on Uber Tristram if built correctly!

	2.5. Mercenary
The optimal Mercenary in my opinion for this Barbarian is an Act 1 Cold Mercenary but only if you can afford Faith. Otherwise, you can either choose a Defensive (Holy Freeze) or Offensive (Might) Act 2 Nightmare Mercenary here depending on if you want even more slow and safety or more Damage.

Optimal Act 1 Mercenary Gear
* Weapon: Faith

* Helm: Ral’d Eth Andariel’s Helm
Optimal Act 2 Mercenary Gear
