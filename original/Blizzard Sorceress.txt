1. Introduction
The Blizzard Sorceress uses Blizzard and Ice Blast or Glacial Spike for large Area of Effect cold damage to slow and freeze enemies in their tracks. She is not only very high powered but also is capable of stacking large amounts of magic find as well while still maintaining high damage output.
2. Quick Reference
2.1. Skill Build
* Blizzard - 20 points - Invest immediately and max out immediately, required
* Cold Mastery - ~26 total points - For PvM, having Cold mastery give over 150% usually is overkill. For this reason, adding enough points to get it close to 150% should cover almost every monster you’re going to face. Maxing will help cover every monster fully, but overall it will not be too much help (since -100 is the lowest resistance a monster can have).
* Glacial Spike - 20 points - Max out after maxing Blizzard and cold mastery is appropriate level
* Ice Blast - 20 points - Max out after maxing Blizzard and cold mastery is appropriate level
* Ice Bolt - 20 points - Max out after maxing Blizzard and cold mastery is appropriate level
* Frozen Armor - 1 point, invest when starting to teleport, required
* Frost Nova - 1 point - prerequisite for Blizzard, required
* Telekinesis - 1 point, prerequisite for teleport, required
* Teleport - 1 point, invest immediately at level 18, required
* Static - 1 point, invested at level 6, let the rest of your plus skills increase its range, required
* Warmth - 1 Point, invested once a higher level with a lot of plus to skills, optional
2.2. Attributes
Strength
Enough strength for gear (156 total)
Dexterity
Enough for gear, should not need to add any points here
Vitality
Everything else into Vitality
Energy
Nothing added here as the Sorceress will get enough mana/regen from skills and gear
