1. Introduction
The Summoner Druid is a very uncommon build as most Druids will end up focusing their skills in the Elemental or Shapeshifting Tree while only using Summons as support. That being said, if a player focuses all of their efforts into the Summoning Tree they can create a build that is effective enough to clear the game while being decently safe. 


One of the hidden traits of the Druid Summoning Skill Tree is that Soft points (Points from +Skills on items) actually improve Synergies for Skills as well as the main Skill. This only applies to the Druid Summoning Tree and no other Skill Tree in the game of Diablo 2. This makes getting + to Skills gear even more important for this character than most others.
