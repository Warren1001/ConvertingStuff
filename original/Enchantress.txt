1. Introduction
The Enchantress can be used in a variety of ways including Enchanting your Party members for overall Party Damage boosts, Enchanting a Mercenary so he can bring Fire damage while your Character does Cold or Lightning Damage, or Enchanting herself to become a Zealot utilizing the Passion Runeword. It is not an extremely common build but when specced appropriately can be very strong and a fun twist to the Sorceress.
