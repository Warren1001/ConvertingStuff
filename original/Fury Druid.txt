1. Introduction
The Fury druid is one of the strongest Melee builds in Diablo 2. With extremely fast Attack Speed and a solid Health Pool, this character can take on even the hardest of bosses in the game. He is better at Single Target Damage rather than fighting large crowds so make sure to be careful in areas like the Chaos Sanctuary where you can get surrounded and Decrepified.
