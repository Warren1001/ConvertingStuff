1. Introduction
The Summon Necromancer is an iconic build dating back to the start of Diablo 2. With a variety of crowd controlling curses and a large army, the Summoner is known for being the safest build in all of Diablo 2.
2. Quick Reference
2.1. Skill Build
* Raise Skeleton - 20 Points - Max immediately, required
* Skeleton Mastery - 20 points - 1 point immediately then max after Raise Skeleton, required
* Clay Golem - 1 point - Get immediately, required
* Corpse Explosion - 1+ points - Extremely useful later on in the game when you have mana for clearing out spaces. One of the best Area of Effect spells in the game. Many summoners max this out for an extremely large range, required
* Teeth - 1 point - prerequisite for Corpse Explosion, required
* Golem Mastery - 1 point - prerequisite to Summon Resist and helps golem, required
* Summon Resist - 1 point - Helps increase resistances for Summons. If lacking lots of additional + to skills, can put more points in here and respec out of it later, required
* Raise Skeletal Mage - 1 point - Prerequisite to Revive. Skeletal mages overall are very disappointing and not often worth the points. If you wish to have them to simply have a larger army though, feel free, optional
* Blood Golem - 1 point - prerequisite for Revive, optional
* Iron Golem - 1 point - prerequisite for Revive, optional
* Fire Golem - 1 point - Optional if you want another golem type to play around with. Clay Golem is usually the best though, optional
* Revive - 1+ points - Usually can just put 1 point here and let your + skills do the rest but feel free to put a few more points to get more revives if you desire, optional
* Amplify Damage - 1 point - Get early on to help with damage for your minions, required
* Decrepify - 1 point - Grab immediately to help minions damage and survivability, required
* Weaken - 1 point - prerequisite to Decrepify, required
