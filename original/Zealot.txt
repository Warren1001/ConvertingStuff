1. Introduction
The Zealot Paladin is a classic fast hitting melee character who can handle a large variety of mobs but lacks in Area of Effect. With a couple of key items he can take down bosses and single monsters extremely quickly. Overall he is one of the stronger melee characters in the game and can play through PvE quite quickly for a physical damage build.
