1. Introduction
The Bone Necromancer is a classic build that can take on a large variety of content due to its main damage type being Magic. It is also extremely safe running Bone Armor and having Bone Prison available when getting overrun. Definitely a top tier build that does not require a lot of expensive gear to be effective.

	2.5. Mercenary
You can either choose a Defensive (Holy Freeze) or Offensive (Might) Act 2 Nightmare Mercenary here depending on if you want even more slow and safety, or want your Mercenary to have added damage. Holy Freeze will lower the amount of corpses you can explode but on this character it will not be too awful and will provide some safety.

* Body Armor: Eth Fortitude
* Helm: Ral’d Eth Andariel’s Helm
Budget Mercenary Gear
