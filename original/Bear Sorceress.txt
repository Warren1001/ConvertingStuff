1. Introduction
The Bear Sorceress Enchantress is one of the most unique builds in the entire game. By taking advantage of the Beast Runeword the Sorceress is able to turn into a Bear while Enchanting herself for large amounts of Fire Damage and using Dream Runewords to gain Lightning Damage further increased by her Lightning Mastery. Overall it is a very expensive build but when fully built out is a ton of fun and can kill even the strongest of bosses in Uber Tristram.
