1. Introduction
The Berserk Barbarian, also known sometimes as a Pitzerker, is the best Magic Finding character in Diablo 2. The reason for this is that not only does he move quickly through areas and have high survivability with his shouts, but he has the skill Item Find that uses his Magic Find every time it successfully pops a corpse. Because of this, the number of unique monsters that he can kill and Magic Find “Double Dip” is higher than any other character thus giving him the title of Greatest Magic Find character in the game.
