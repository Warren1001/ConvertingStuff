1. Introduction
The Singer Barbarian is a funny build made viable by the skill Warcry stunning and doing damage. Not relying on physical damage from good weapons, this build is surprisingly not too item dependent making a PvE playthrough a bit easier than a standard Melee character might find. That being said, the damage ultimately does top out a bit lower than one would like, making it a less than optimal end game build.
