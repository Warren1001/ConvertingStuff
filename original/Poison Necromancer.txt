1. Introduction
The Poison Necromancer is a highly gear dependent character that can tackle large groups of mobs at high player numbers on their own. With Poison skills lacking in synergies, it also opens up the ability to mix Poison with other kinds of skills for a big variety. Once geared uip, this is one of the strongest characters in the game for PvE.
