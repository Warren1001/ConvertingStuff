1. Introduction
The Frenzy Barbarian is one of the least gear dependent Barbarian builds that you can make. With high attack and movement speed, this character can quickly dismantle its foes. This build also begins with Double Swing at level 6 and can be very solid for leveling throughout the game. Overall one of the best Barbarian PvE builds around.

You can either choose a Defensive (Holy Freeze) or Offensive (Might) Act 2 Nightmare Mercenary here depending on if you want even more slow and safety, or want your Mercenary to have added damage to help take care of cold immunes. I prefer a might mercenary.
