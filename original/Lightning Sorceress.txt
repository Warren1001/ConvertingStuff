1. Introduction
The Lightning Sorceress is the fastest Chaos Sanctuary clearing character in the game, known for her extremely high damage output and mobility. While fragile, when you pair this Sorceress up with an Infinity Mercenary there are very few places she cannot clear quickly.

	2.5. Mercenary
You can either choose a Defensive (Holy Freeze) or Offensive (Might) Act 2 Nightmare Mercenary here depending on if you want even more slow and safety, or want your Mercenary to have added damage to help take care of Light immunes. I prefer a Holy Freeze mercenary.
