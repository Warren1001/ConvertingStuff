1. Introduction
The Goldfind Barbarian is a later game build designed to collect as much Gold as fast as possible. This build is actually very low budget and focuses on increasing the Gold Find of the Barbarian while giving a Mercenary enough damage to clear out the mobs. While not the most popular build, it is extremely fun to pick up massive sums of gold and satisfies any gambling habit.
