1. Introduction
The Smiter Paladin is the strongest and easiest class used for soloing Uber Tristram. With a strong single target stunning attack that never misses and a high life total replenished by lifetap, the Smiter can take down the Ubers or any boss with extremely budget gear. While he is extremely good at single target killing, he does suffer from no area of effect skill which limits his overall kill speed in crowded areas.
