1. Introduction
The Meteorb Sorceress is a classic combination bringing together the crowd control of Cold and the firepower of Fire to create a perfectly blended character capable of tackling almost any monster in the game. One of the biggest difficulties that a Sorceress has in this game is dealing with Resistance Immunities, so by running two different elements it helps alleviate those issues. Frozen Orb is a low skill investment option that can still bring a lot of power and thus is often used to supplement another build.
2. Quick Reference
2.1. Skill Build
* Frozen Orb - 20 Points - Max immediately, required
* Cold Mastery - ~26 total points - For PvM, having Cold mastery give over 150% usually is overkill. For this reason, adding enough points to get it close to 150% should cover almost every monster you’re going to face. Maxing will help cover every monster fully, but overall it will not be too much help (since -100 is the lowest resistance a monster can have).
