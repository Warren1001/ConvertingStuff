1. Introduction
The Avenger Paladin is a somewhat gear dependent character that runs Conviction and Vengeance to deal Physical and Elemental damage to mobs. Because of this large mixture, he is able to kill most monsters in the game making him fun for people who hate Immunities. He does not have any AOE skill so while his Single Target damage is nice, avoiding large amounts of monsters at once is optimal.
